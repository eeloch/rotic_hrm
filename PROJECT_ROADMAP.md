# ROTIC HRM Project Roadmap

## Product Vision

ROTIC HRM is a unified human resources platform for managing employees, attendance, payroll, leave, performance, training, assets, recruitment, and reporting in one coherent system. The product should support day-to-day HR operations reliably, scale with organizational growth, and remain maintainable as new modules are added.

## Architectural Principles

- Keep business logic in services, not views or UI components.
- Prefer small, focused modules with clear ownership and stable interfaces.
- Design APIs to be predictable, versionable, and easy to integrate.
- Preserve data integrity with validation, auditing, and explicit relationships.
- Build reusable frontend components and shared design patterns early.
- Favor simple, proven approaches before introducing complexity.
- Treat integrations as first-class features with error handling and observability.

## Coding Standards

- Use consistent naming, formatting, and file structure across backend and frontend code.
- Separate models, serializers, services, views, and URLs in the backend.
- Keep frontend pages thin and move shared UI into reusable components.
- Write tests for core business rules, edge cases, and integration points.
- Document important domain decisions and schema changes as the system evolves.
- Avoid breaking changes unless there is a clear migration path.
